# The Business Rule Specifications sheet contains the following items.

- Statement: This is the text of the business rule itself. It should be clear
and succinct and should convey the required constraints without any
confusion or ambiguity. Here’s an example of a well-framed statement:
A booking agent cannot be assigned to more than 25 entertainers.
- Constraint: This is a brief explanation of how the constraint applies to
the tables and fields. 
- Category: This is where you indicate whether the rule is field specific
or relationship specific.
- Test On: Here is where you indicate which actions (insert, delete,
update) will test the constraint the business rule imposes.
- Structures Affected: Depending on the type of business rule, the
constraint will affect either a field or a relationship. This is where you
designate the name of the field(s) the rule will affect or the name of the
table(s) involved in the relationship that the rule affects.
- Field Elements Affected: A business rule that pertains to a field can
affect one or more elements of that field’s specifications. This is where you indicate the elements the rule affects.
- Relationship Characteristics Affected: A business rule that pertains to
a relationship will affect one or more of the relationship’s
characteristics. Here is where you indicate the characteristics that the
rule affects.
- Action Taken: Here you indicate the modifications you’ve made to the
elements of a field specification or to a relationship diagram. It is very
important that the statement you enter here be as clear and
unambiguous as possible. Should a problem occur as a result of
enforcing this business rule, this statement serves as accurate
documentation of the steps you have taken to establish the rule. You
can use this statement to make certain that these steps were actually
carried out and that the rule has been properly established.
